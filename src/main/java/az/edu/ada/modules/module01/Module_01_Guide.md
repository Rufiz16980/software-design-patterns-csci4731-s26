## Module 1 Guide: Foundations & SOLID

### Dates:

- **Week #1:** _Jan 22_
- **Week #2:** _Jan 27 – Jan 29_

### Topics:

- **Lecture 01:** _Course Intro, Tools (IntelliJ, Git), "Why Design Matters"._
- **Lecture 02:** _OOP Refresher (Polymorphism, Interfaces) & UML._
- **Lecture 03:** _SOLID Principles (SRP & OCP)._

### Learning Objectives:

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

    - Set up the professional development environment (JDK 17+, IntelliJ IDEA Community, Git, GitHub).
    - Explain why bad design leads to "technical debt" and high maintenance costs.
    - Read and draw basic UML Class Diagrams (Inheritance vs. Composition).
    - Apply the first two SOLID principles: Single Responsibility (SRP) and Open/Closed (OCP).

#### Reading Checklist:

- _Head First Design Patterns:_ Intro Chapter (pp. 1–30) & Chapter 1 (Strategy Pattern intro).

### The Architect’s Tip:

    Many students rush past UML thinking it is outdated. In the industry, we don't write code until we draw the box. 
    If you can't whiteboard the relationship between your classes, you aren't ready to code them. Pay attention to the 
    arrows,knowing the difference between 'Is-A' (Inheritance) and 'Has-A' (Composition) is 50% of the midterm.
